      <h1>Welcome to the <span style="color: rgb(109, 67, 207);"> Creative Coding Club </span> </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the <strong> Creative Coding Club. </strong> We are a group of passionate students who love building
        new and innovative tools. Our mission is to make programming accessible to everyone, regardless of their
        prior experience with coding. Whether you are a complete beginner or a seasoned developer, there is a place
        for you here. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        At the <strong> Creative Coding Club </strong>, we believe that coding isn’t just for solving problems, it is
        also a way to explore new ideas, an outlet for creativity, a way to socialise and also bring concepts to life.
        Members of the <strong> Creative Coding Club </strong> get hands-on experience with building and designing
        projects, decided upon by the club members.

      </p>
      <p>
        Club members meet up once a month to brainstorm a new project and divide roles among the team. Each project
        runs for about a month, and at the end, members present what they’ve created. Either as a finished product or
        a work in progress during the showcase session. This allows users a chance to collaborate, experiment and gain
        real-world experience working on a team-based coding project

      </p>
      <h3>previous projects include</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Pixel Playground</li>
          <li>ChatBox Challenge</li>
          <li>Website in a weekend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is a fun, hands-on way to build real-world coding experience, meet like-minded people, and create something
          meaningful as a team. If this sounds like you
