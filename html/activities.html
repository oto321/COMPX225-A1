                We dove into the world of generative art using JavaScript and the p5.js library. Members created
                interactive sketches and visual pieces that responded to user input, sound, and movement. The final
                showcase included a digital gallery of everyone's art and even a few live coding performances.

                Each member will design and code a mini-game using JavaScript, Unity, or Godot. We'll run workshops on
                game loops, collision detection, and sprite animation. The final session will be a “Game Jam Arcade”
                where we try each other’s games.

              <p>
                This month, the team tackled natural language processing by building fun and quirky chatbots using
                Python and a no-code UI tool. Beginners learned about basic logic and flow control, while advanced
                members helped integrate OpenAI’s API to make the bots smarter.

                We’re demystifying artificial intelligence by building simple models in tools like Teachable Machine and
                TensorFlow.js. No math-heavy lectures here—just fun, visual experiments in image recognition, voice
                commands, and personal AI assistants.

                Website in a Weekend
              </h2>
              <p>
                A rapid prototyping challenge where members worked in small teams to build a complete website in just
                two days. From portfolios and fan sites to web-based games, the results were creative, chaotic, and
                surprisingly polished. The winning site was a “Study Buddy” that gamified revision habits.

                A month-long campus hackathon where members build tools that could help students, like timetable
                planners, lost-item finders, or club discovery apps. Teams will pitch their solutions to a panel of
                student reps and compete for small prizes.
